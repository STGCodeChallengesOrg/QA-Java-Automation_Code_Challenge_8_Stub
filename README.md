QA Java Automation Code Challenge #8 (Crawler and image verification):

Extension of the crawler challenge.  As you navigate through the site, find every broken image.

Go to https://www.skiutah.com/

Verify that each reference to an image displays the image correctly and not a dead image.  Log every page that has a
broken image to a text file.

The sample code stub is found in the Utils.java file.


Refer to the Git Procedure Step By Step document, which contains detailed instructions for accessing code stubs and submitting completed work from/to GitHub.
